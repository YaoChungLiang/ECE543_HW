Q1: explain what rospy.Service()and rospy.ServiceProxy()do respectively?
A1:
  rospy.Service():
     Contains a request message and a response message
  rospy.ServiceProxy():
     Create a handle to a ROS service for invoking calls.


Q2: What happens if you take out the line ¡§rospy.wait_for_service¡¨, and whyis it happening?
A2:
   It depends on the order of launch your roslauch file, If you launch    my_kuka_server.launch first, then that will runs well. However, if you run    the FK_test.launch first, it will die in the process because there is no    the service there, so it will die when using serviceProxy.


Q3: What does the ¡§---¡¨is a service file mean?
A3:
   To seperate the request and response.
